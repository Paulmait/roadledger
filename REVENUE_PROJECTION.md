## Risk Factors (Conservative Adjustments Already Applied)

1. **App Store Rejection** - Built to Apple guidelines, reviewed EULA
2. **Competition** - Features like Load Calculator differentiate us
3. **Economic Downturn** - Trucking is essential, recession-resistant
4. **Churn** - Used 5% monthly (industry avg is 3-4% for SaaS)
5. **Conversion** - Used 8-15% (industry avg is 10-20% for freemium)

---

## Growth Levers (Not Included in Conservative Projection)

These could accelerate growth but are NOT factored into the above numbers:

1. **Viral Loops** - Referral rewards ($5 credit per referral)
2. **Enterprise/Fleet Tier** - $99/mo per vehicle for small fleets
3. **Data Monetization** - Anonymized lane/rate data (with consent)
4. **Partnerships** - Trucking associations, fuel card integrations
5. **International** - Canada, Mexico (IFTA compliance there too)

---
